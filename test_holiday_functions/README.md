# Test Holiday Functions

In this folder there are two files:

1. `test_purple_holiday_functions.py`
2. `test_orange_holiday_functions.py`

Your assignment is to add **two** test assertions to the file belonging to your
section, following (but not copying) the pattern established in the file.

These test files use assert statements. If the expression in an assert statement
is false, then the program throws an error and stops executing immediately. 

All of these assert statements are good:

```py
# Good 👍
assert True
assert not False
assert 1 + 1 == 2
assert not 1 > 2
```

Whereas these assert statements are bad. They will cause the program to exit
with an error message:

```py
# Bad 👎
assert not True
assert False
assert 1 + 1 != 2
assert 1 > 2
```

## How to add your tests, step by step

### Step 1

Click on the test file corresponding to your section (orange or purple).

### Step 2

Click the "Edit this file" button, shown in the screen shot below (on the right):

This will open the file in a text editor in your browser.

### Step 3

Find your name and fill two lines below your name, each with one assert statement. 

Do not change the number of lines below your name. There should be exactly three 
lines below your name. The first two lines are for your two assert statements, 
each on a separate line. The third line is meant to be left blank.

Then click the green "Commit changes..." button in the upper right, shown in the 
following screenshot:

Add a commit message, then press "Commit changes"

If all went well, your changes should be saved to the file.
